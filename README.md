### Usage
~~I recommend to use [my Raw Git CDN link] (https://cdn.rawgit.com/Szuzs/heading-font-face/2d0e3836/stylesheet.css)~~

Since [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/) is shutting down, switched to using GH-pages. It's a wonderful, production-ready and serves static files easily.

Use the updated [link](https://szuzs.github.io/heading-font-face/stylesheet.css).
